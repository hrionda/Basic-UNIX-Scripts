### Basic-UNIX-Scripts
Contained is a collection of some basic UNIX scripts that demostrate some of the basic concepts of Bash scripting as they apply in a systems administration context.

The basicscript.sh script demonstrates some of the basics of scripting such as echo, read, sleep, for/while loops, and if/then/else/fi statements.

The SysAdmin folder contains scripts that pull information from a CSV file to make changes in the OS or in a SQL/NoSQL database.

The ACGTscript folder contains a script that is mainly meant to count the number of ACGT substrings in the human genome.
NOTE: The file representing the human genome was too big to upload so this script may not work, but is confirmed to work given an input file of the same name.
